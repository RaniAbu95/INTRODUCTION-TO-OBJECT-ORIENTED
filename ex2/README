=============================
We were responsible for designing our ships classes.
I made a class which called Space Ship which had a created methods without 
implementation, and I choose that class to be the super class, and all other 
ships classes are extends from it (which make them sub-classes.
All the classes share the same implemtation for all the methods except the 
doAction and the fire method so I decided to override those methods in the 
needed classes.

=============================
We were told to create special and drunkard space ship. The special space ship 
is faster than all the space ship, attempt to fire in every round, always with the
shield up and teleporting every 20 rounds. The drunkard ship is a ship that flies in circular way, teleports after 
several rounds, doesn't shot(drunk ships can't shot).
