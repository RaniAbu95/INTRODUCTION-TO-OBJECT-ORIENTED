packages:

1.filters: contains all the filters classes.

2.orders: contains all the order classes.

3.exceptions: contains the warning and the error classes.

4.DirectoryProcessor.java - The class that manage the program and connect all 
the necessary classes with each other. It has a main method which runs the
whole program, the main's args is a directory and a command file, the command
file make its command on this directory and at the end we get sorted printed
files which passed a filteration first.

=============================
Order.java: super class for all the orders. All the order classes extends this class and 
implements one method of this class which is compare() that deside in which order to sort
the files.

Filter.java: An interface for the filter classes which they all implements.
it has two methods which desides how to make the filter process.

=============================
=         Exceptions       =
=============================
I made two classes that extend the java exception class.
The first is Warning.java that is responsible for printing the warning messages.
The second is Error.java that is responsible for printing the errors messages.
They both have a void method which prints a suitable message to the user.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I used two arrays the first contains the filtered files and the second is for the sorted files.
I itterate over the filtered files and in each iteration I find the max between all the filtered 
files and place it in the correct place in the sorted array.
